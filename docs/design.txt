Project Name: Final Customer App

Files:

db.py:
Handles SQLite database connection and customer table operations including creation, insertion, retrieval, update, deletion, and resetting ID sequences.

business.py:
Contains the application logic for managing customers. Validates inputs, calls database functions, and processes results for adding, listing, searching, removing, and updating customer records.

ui.py:
Provides a text-based user interface with a menu-driven system to interact with users. Displays options, receives user inputs, and shows formatted results and messages.

Final.sqlite:
The SQLite database file created automatically by the app to persistently store customer data.

design.txt:
This document describing the appâ€™s design, file responsibilities, and overall structure.

Description:

This app enables users to:

Add customers by entering name and email with validation.

List all customers in a formatted table.

Remove customers by their ID.

Search customers by name or email keywords.

Update customer email by ID.

Exit the program gracefully.

The app uses a layered architecture:

Database Layer (db.py): Manages all direct database interactions ensuring persistent data storage and integrity.

Business Layer (business.py): Applies validation and business rules, connecting UI with the database layer.

User Interface Layer (ui.py): Handles user input/output through a command-line menu, guiding the user and displaying information clearly.

Additional Notes:

The app automatically creates the database and tables if they do not exist.

The ID for customers auto-increments and can be reset when no records remain.

Errors are handled gracefully with messages guiding the user.

The design follows clean separation of concerns to facilitate maintenance and testing.
