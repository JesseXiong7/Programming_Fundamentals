Problem Statement:

A program is required to prompt the user for their height and weight in either metric or imperial units. 
If the user chooses metric, they will input their height in meters and weight in kilograms. 
If the user chooses imperial, they will input their height in inches and weight in pounds. 
The program will then calculate the user's Body Mass Index (BMI) using the appropriate formula:

For metric units:
BMI = weight(kg) / height(m)^2

For imperial units:
BMI = weight(lbs) × 703 / height (in)^2
 
The program will display the calculated BMI and categorize it into one of the following ranges:

Underweight: BMI < 18.5
Normal weight: 18.5 ≤ BMI < 24.9
Overweight: 25 ≤ BMI < 29.9
Obese: BMI ≥ 30
The program will allow the user to choose between metric or imperial units, input their height and weight, and display
the corresponding BMI and category. The user will then have the option to recalculate their BMI or exit the program.

Defining Diagram:

Inputs:
Height: Stores the users input for height in either Meters or Inches.
Weight: Stores the users input for wight in either Kilograms or Pounds.
Unit choice: Stores metric or imperial measurements. 

// Processing steps
Prompt user to choose metric or imperial.
input their measurements.
calculate BMI using either metric or imperial function.
display category: underweight, normal, overweight, obese.
recalculate BMI is user so chooses
otherwise user can exit. 

Outputs: 
BMI value
Category

Pseudocode: BMI Calculator with Metric and Imperial Units

1. Display Initial Setup:
Show unit selection dropdown (metric or imperial)
Show appropriate input fields based on the unit system selected (metric or imperial)

2. Input unit_choice:
Get the selected unit system (unit)

3. Display Inputs Based on Unit System:
If unit is "metric":
Show weight and height input fields for metric (kg, m)
Hide imperial input fields
Else if unit is "imperial":
Show weight and height input fields for imperial (lbs, inches)
Hide metric input fields

4. Input Weight and Height Based on Unit:
If unit is "metric":
Get weight_metric (kg)
Get height_metric (m)
Validate that both weight_metric > 0 and height_metric > 0
If not valid:
Display an alert: "Please enter valid values for weight and height."
Exit the function and ask for new input.

Else If unit is "imperial":
Get weight_imperial (lbs)
Get height_imperial (inches)
Validate that both weight_imperial > 0 and height_imperial > 0
If not valid:
Display an alert: "Please enter valid values for weight and height."
Exit the function and ask for new input.

5. BMI Calculation:
If unit is "metric":
Calculate BMI as bmi = weight_metric / (height_metric * height_metric)
Else If unit is "imperial":
Calculate BMI as bmi = (weight_imperial * 703) / (height_imperial * height_imperial)

6. Classify BMI:
If bmi < 18.5:
Set classification = "Underweight"
Else If 18.5 <= bmi < 24.9:
Set classification = "Normal weight"
Else If 25 <= bmi < 29.9:
Set classification = "Overweight"
Else if bmi >= 30:
Set classification = "Obese"

7. Display Results:
Display BMI with two decimal places: BMI: [bmi] - [classification]

8. Ask User to Recalculate or Exit:
Display a confirmation message: "Would you like to calculate again?"
If the user clicks "OK":
Call resetCalculator() to reset input fields and results for a new calculation
If the user clicks "Cancel":
Display a message: "Thank you for using the BMI calculator!"
Exit the program

9. Reset Calculator Function (resetCalculator):
Clear all input fields for weight and height
Clear the result text
Set unit to "metric" by default
Show metric inputs, hide imperial inputs
End of Program

TEST CASE 1:
	INPUT VALUES: Weight = 70kg. 
		      Height = 1.75m (Metric)
	EXPECTED OUTPUT: BMI = 22.86, Category = Normal
	ACTUAL OUTPUT: BMI: 22.86 - Normal weight

TEST CASE 2: 
	INPUT VALUES: Weight = 154lbs
		      Height = 68in (Imperial)
